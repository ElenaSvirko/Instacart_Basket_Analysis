# Instacart_Basket_Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics program, where I assumed the role of a data analyst for Instacart, an online grocery delivery and pickup service. The objective was to analyze customer purchasing behaviors to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance sales performance.​

**Objectives**

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective is to perform exploratory analysis of over 3 million Instacart orders to gain insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Key questions/requests from the marketing team include:

*   What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
*   At what times do customers spend the most money?
*   With Instacart’s wide range of product prices, what recommendations can simplify price range groupings to better guide marketing efforts?
*   Are there specific types of products that are more popular than others?
*   How is brand loyalty distributed among users?
*   Do ordering habits vary based on a customer’s loyalty status?
*   Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
*   Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?
*   What classifications can be derived from demographic information, such as age, income, types of goods, and family status?
*   How do ordering habits differ among various customer profiles?
